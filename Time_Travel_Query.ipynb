    "Db2 offers a rich set of temporal data management capabilities collectively known as Db2 Time Travel Query. Db2 Time Travel Query is a catchall for a number of related technologies that include temporal tables, temporal queries, temporal updates, and temporal constraints, along with other temporal functionality. All of these capabilities are available in all Db2 editions, so there are no licensing considerations when you want to use this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to implement some kind of time travel capability before Db2 10, you had to create triggers and complex application logic to trace data changes, manage effective dates, and enforce temporal constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through simple declarative SQL statements, you can instruct Db2 to maintain a history of database changes or track effective business dates automatically, eliminating the need for such logic to be hand-coded into triggers, stored procedures, or application code: this is a tremendous benefit."

    "Now the discussion moves to application-period temporal tables and begins with a brief description of application-period temporal tables (ATTs). Application-period temporal tables allow the storage of time-sensitive data. This makes it possible to store information such as insurance policy terms on different dates. As an example, if Joe Smith purchases an automobile policy on 01/01/2010 with a liability coverage of `$50,000` and then upgrades the policy on 03/01/2011 to increase the liability coverage to `$250,000`, ATTs allow the storage of the automobile insurance with different liability coverage for different date ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key difference between ATTs and the STTs that were previously discussed is that ATTs require a pair of columns defining the begin time and end time (defined as either a TIMESTAMP or DATE data type) to represent the time range where the data is valid.  These two values are controlled by the user and/or application.  Db2 adds, splits, or deletes rows as needed, automatically and transparently. These time values can be used to model data in the past, present, or future, by restricting queries to specific date ranges and allowing data to be defined as valid for specific dates only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Db2 supports constraints automatically to disallow overlapping validity periods for a data record. Another difference from STTs is that ATTs do NOT have a separate history table. All date ranges for a particular record are stored in the base table."

    "## Creating an Application Period Temporal Table\n",

    "This `CREATE TABLE` statement will build an application-period temporal table named ATT.TRAVEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the example syntax, two columns (bus_start and bus_end) are defined as DATE NOT NULL and the ATT is activated via the \"PERIOD BUSINESS TIME (bus_start, bus_end)\" clause.  The bus_start date is inclusive and the bus_end date is exclusive, with the additional restriction that bus_start must be less than the bus_end column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional clause on the PRIMARY KEY clause \"BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS\" enforces period uniqueness within the table.  In other words, two records for the same trip cannot overlap between their bus_start and bus_end times.  So there is only one valid trip_name for each trip during each time period. As an example, for a trip named \"Grand Canyon\", you could only have one \"price\" valid for any time period. It would be valid to have a price of `$500` valid for 01/01/2011 to 06/30/2011 and a price of `$550` valid for 06/30/2011 to 12/31/2011.  However, you could not have both `$500` and `$550` valid for a single date (04/01/2011) because of this `WITHOUT OVERLAPS` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The bus_end time is exclusive, therefore the bus_end time of 06/30/2011 for Grand Canyon Record 1 does NOT overlap with the bus_start time of 06/30/2011 for Grand Canyon Record 2."
